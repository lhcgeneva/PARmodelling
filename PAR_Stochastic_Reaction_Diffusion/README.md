PAR_Stochastic_Reaction_Diffusion
=================================

Implements PAR reaction diffusion network as a stochastic simulation, based on propensity functions derived from the PDEs describing the system's evolution in time and space.

  - Uses Gillespie algorithm
  - For now reflecting boundary conditions, periodic on the way
  - Need to implement surface to volume conversion factor
  - Need to use the right particle counts
